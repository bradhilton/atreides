      " to solve this murder mystery. Let's see, there are two suspects: Mr. Green and Colonel Mustard. Weapons found are a knife and a lead pipe. The murder happened in one of two rooms: Gazebo or Trophy Room. The victim, Mr. Boddy, is found dead, and the room he was in must have both the weapon and the suspect. \n",

      "Wait, the layout is a bit unclear. The rows are row 1, which has room N. Then rows 2 and 3 are presented with W1, W2, W3 on the bottom? Hmm, maybe it's more like:\n",

      "Row 3: W2 E  \n",

      "And then S is the south? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the layout is such that the rooms are arranged in a cross: N is north, W1, W2, and South. So maybe the rooms are N, W1/E, W2/E, and S. So four rooms in total: N, W1/E, W2/E, S. But the problem says the rooms are either Gazebo or Trophy Room, so maybe one is Gazebo and the other is Trophy Room, and theipes are in perhaps one of them.\n",

      "Clue 2: Green in room S' (south of Mr. Boddy)\n",

      "So the lead pipe or knife is in the room where Mr. Boddy is, and simultaneously in the room where Green is.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, that can't be, because the lead pipe was in the room just south of Mr. Boddy, and Green was in the room just south of him as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that means both rooms have the same weapon? But the weapons found are knife and lead pipe. So unless it's a single location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe it's about the layout. Let's think of Mr. Boddy in one room, and the room to his south has the weapon and the suspect(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "But since only one weapon is there, the victim must be in a room that has both the weapon and the suspect, i.e., in the same room there is the weapon and the suspect located there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the crime scene has two weapons: knife and lead pipe. So it's possible that a single room has both.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the layout requires that two rooms have one weapon each (south of the victim and South of Green), but the same room would need to have two weapons? That seems impossible because you can't have two weapons in a single room.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the layout.\n",

      "N  \n",
      "W 1 E  \n",
      "W 2 E  \n",
      "  S  \n",
      "\n",
      "So it's east-west columns, with N (north) and S (south), and two middle W1, W2, each with E rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for example, maybe it's:\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 1: N  \n",
      "Row 2: W1 (and E1?)  \n",
      "Row 3: W2 (and E2?)  \n",
      "Row 4: S  \n",
      "\n",
      "So four rooms: N, W1/E1, W2/E2, and S.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the South direction would point to room S, East of that is E2, and West of N is W1/E1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says \"the murder occurs in one of the rooms: Gazebo or Trophy Room.\" So presumably, among the four rooms: N, W1/E, W2/E, S, two of them are Gazebo and Trophy Room. So maybe W1/E is one, and S is the other, or one is called Gazebo and the other Trophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think the possible rooms are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Gazebo\n",
      "\n",
      "- Trophy Room\n",
      "\n",
      "They are in the two rooms, so room numbers are perhaps one is Gazebo and the other is Trophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the layout is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Top: N  \n",
      "- Middle (left): W1/E  \n",
      "- Middle (right): W2/E  \n",
      "- Bottom: S \n",
      "\n",
      "So it's a 4-room grid: North, W1, W2, South.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming Gazebo is North, and Trophy is South, or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the layout is clear, the key clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lead pipe is in room just south of Mr. Boddy\n",
      "\n",
      "- Green is in room just south of Mr. Boddy\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the victim is in room X, south of X is another room with the weapon and the suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this seems conflicting because if it's the same weapon, then it would have to be a duplicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the weapons are different: knife and lead pipe, so each is in their own room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, perhaps the layout has separate rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the rooms are only two: the center columns with W and E? So rooms are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Left: W1/E  \n",
      "- Middle: center  \n",
      "- Right: W2/E  \n",
      "\n",
      "But in the given layout, it's N, W1 E, W2 E, and S. So maybe it's 4 rooms with N, west, east, south.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rooms:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. North (N)\n",
      "2. West (W1)\n",
      "3. East (W2)\n",
      "4. South (S)\n",
      "\n",
      "If that's the case, then the south of N would be S, and the south of W1 would be S?\n",
      "\n",
      "But the south of W1 is W2, and W2's south is S. So if the lead pipe is in the room just south of the victim, it could be S. Similarly, Green is South of the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the victim is in S, then both Green and the lead pipe are in S. But the same room can't have both weapons unless the weapon is leading pipe, but maybe they could have been in the same room, but each location would have a separate weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me lay it out step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lead pipe is in the room just south of Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Green is in the room just south of Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So both the victim's room and the room south have the weapon (lead pipe). Similarly, both the victim's room and the room south have the suspect (Green). But that would require that both Green and the victim are in the same room, which can't happen unless they're the same person, which isn't the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the layout is such that south of a room is another room on the same level. So for example, in the middle row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the layout is:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Room Structure]\n",
      "\n",
      "Visualizing the rooms as a grid:\n",
      "\n",
      "N\n",
      "\n",
      "W1 E\n",
      "\n",
      "W2 E\n",
      "\n",
      "S  \n",
      "\n",
      "So N is the top, then moving down, W1 and E are in the middle, W2 and further down are S.\n",

      "\n",
      "Similarly, for E1, it's not mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since only Gazebo and Trophy Room are suspect rooms, maybe the east and west rooms are either Gazebo or Trophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says the murderer and Mr. Boddy must have been alone in a room with at least one weapon. So they must be in a room with a weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the weapon is either in Gazebo or Trophy, and the suspect is in the same room.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the victim is in Gazebo, which is maybe room 1, then the south of her would be S room, which is Trophy Room if that's the layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the layout is such that W1 and W2 are side rooms, with N, W1, W2, S arranged in a 4-room grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's assume that the layout has North, Left, Center, Right, South. So:\n",

      "If that's the case, then the South of North is Right (S), which is Trophy Room. South of Center is Right (S), which is also Trophy. The south isn't a room in this layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in this setup, the south of south would be North again if it's a toroidal layout, but that might complicate.\n",
      "\n",

      "B. What weapon did the murderer use?\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Where was the murder committed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the layout affects the south direction, it's crucial to determine which room has the weapon and suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming the layout is:\n",
      "\n",
      "       S (south)\n",
      "\n",
      "       E     W1 E\n",
      "       W     W2 E\n",
      "Top     N\n",

      "In this case, the south of N is S, the south of W1=E is S, and the south of W2=E is S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, if the victim is in the south, then the weapon and suspect are in S, but S is the dealer's room, and N, W1, W2 are adjacent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps S is the trophy room, and W1/E is the west room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lead pipe is in the room just south of Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Green is in the room just south of Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This implies that the same south room has both the weapon (lead pipe) and the suspect (Green). However, the lead pipe is only one, and Green is another.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems conflicting unless Mr. Boddy and Green are in the same room with the same south, which can't happen. Therefore, perhaps the layout is such that both the victim and Green are in the same room, but that's impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, to resolve this, it's likely that the lead pipe is in the south, which is either the same for Green or different.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the clues, if both Green and the lead pipe are in the south, but the lead pipe is a single weapon, it must mean Green and the victim are in the same room with a weapon and suspect. Since Green and the victim can't be the same, perhaps the victim is in the south room, and Green is in the north. But this is speculative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the layout is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rooms:\n",
      "\n",
      "N  \n",
      "W1  \n",
      "W2   \n",
      "S  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, N is top, W1 and W2 are adjacent, S is bottom. But that's not matching the initial layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the initial layout given is:\n",

      "N  \n",
      "W 1 E  \n",
      "W 2 E  \n",
      "  S  \n",
      "\n",
      "So four rooms: N, W1/E, W2/E, S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, If the victim is in room S, then the south of S doesn't exist. So perhaps the problem is such that the south of the victim is in a different room. But that would mean the victim is in W1/E or W2/E, each of whose south is S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the victim is in W1/E, south of him is S.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says both Green and the lead pipe are in the south of him, which would only be possible if the victim is in S, which isn't logical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the conclusion is that Green and the lead pipe are in the same room south of the victim, meaning the victim is in a room where the south leads elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps reorganizing:\n",
      "\n",
      "A better layout might have the South pointing to a different room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps they are in different rooms, but that complicates.\n",

      "1. N  \n",
      "2. W1/E  \n",
      "3. S  \n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming S is the trophy room and W1/E is the west room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the south of N is S, the south of W1/E is S. But that causes duplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rooms arranged as:\n",
      "\n",
      "N  \n",
      "    W1 E  \n",
      "      S  \n",
      "    W2 E  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, S is the south of W1/E, and the south of N is not a separate room but the same S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the victim is in W1/E, south of him is S (trophy room).\n",
      "\n",
      "Green is in a room south of him, which would have to be another room south of W1/E, which is S, but only one weapon exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is conflicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed without knowing the exact layout, deducing based on clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the clues, since Green is in the south of Mr. Boddy and the lead pipe is in the south, it's likely that the victim is in a room whose south direction leads to the same room where the weapon and suspect are, but this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the layout requires that the same room has both, but that's impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the weapon is in the same room as the suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, after much analysis, I think:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Green murder theosite.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Lead pipe used.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Trophy room.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps Gise some exact answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, to proceed without overcomplicating, given that in such logic puzzles, the layout is often North, West, South, East. So room setups:\n",
      "\n",
      "Top (N), west (W1), south (S), east (E1), bottom (S1?).\n",
      "\n",
      "But given that only two weapons and two suspect rooms are possible, maybe the layout is more potentially deducible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without the exact layout, it's challenging. So, perhaps the clue is that the lead pipe is in the south of the victim, so the victim is in a room whose south is the lead pipe room, which is in turn where the Green is. But this is conflicting unless it's a single room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, after struggling, perhaps the answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Green, B. Lead pipe, C. Trophy Room.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Green is in the south of Mr. Boddy, and lead pipe is in the south of him, they are in the same room, but that's impossible. Thus, perhaps Mr. Boddy is in a room with one weapon and the other suspect is in another room, but both souths lead to the same room, thus both are in the same room, which is impossible unless same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, this suggests a miscalculation or misinterpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the time, perhaps I'll conclude:\n",

      "The victim is in a room where Green is and south leads to the lead pipe. Hence:\n",
